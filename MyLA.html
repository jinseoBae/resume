        Since January 2020, I’ve been working for Dr. Teasley’s Learning, Education, & Design Lab on the My Learning Analytics project. 
        This project evaluates how student use of the dashboard software over time has changed their self-regulated learning behaviors, 
        and provided me with the opportunity to apply analytics techniques that I learned from my graduate courses in the context of human-computer interaction. 
        As a graduate research assistant, I worked closely with two other researchers to create a new survey-response codebook and to manually code survey data collected over three semesters.
        In coding the responses, we not only represented student experiences but also captured what factors stop them from using the dashboard so that the system design 
        can be improved based on user experiences. To ensure accurate coding, I devised an automated algorithm that compared our manually-assigned codes and calculated our reliability. 
        Once we consistently achieved reliability scores of over 80%, we divided the previously-collected surveys and coded each response based on our codebook. We have already made some 
        improvements to the dashboard based on our findings, and the system is being used more more extensively throughout the campus. We have also created our own website to help students 
        better understand the dashboard and thereby increase student usage. 
        <br>

        Currently, I am working with Professor Popov Vitaliy from the LED lab to perform an Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) that examines the relationship between coded elements 
        in student responses by quantifying their co-occurrences. We are planning to publish the findings of this work as a chapter in a book honoring Professor Stuart Karabenick 
        from the School of Education, who has been a long-time collaborator on our MyLA project. Also, our dashboard design team is planning to launch a new pop-up style of survey 
        to more effectively collect student responses. As part of this, I am responsible for selecting design examples and developing survey questions for use in the new design. 
        We are planning to use questions with rating scales and multiple choice questions.
        <br><br>
        I have also been working on an independent project, creating an NLP algorithm that extracts words corresponding to each of the codebook categories. 
        Using regular expressions to count word frequency and to determine what kinds of sentences hold what words gives considerable insight into user experience (UX) of the software.
        Furthermore, extracting all responses that contained the most commonly-used word revealed a strong correlation between class structure and dashboard usage. 
        The results from this investigation will be used to improve the UX so as to ultimately facilitate students’ self-regulated learning. 
        This work has not only taught me how to carry out a research project, but also revealed the research path I would most like to pursue in my future career: using NLP and machine 
        learning techniques to improve user experience.
