        Working for the EMERGE project in the Department of Emergency Medicine allowed me to build on that experience by applying text analytics 
        and NLP in healthcare. As an information science intern, I assisted Dr. Medlin in managing their database and mapping datasets during analyses. 
        My first task was to create taxonomy evaluation algorithms in Python that categorized records from 10 different countries according to reason for ER visit and final diagnosis. 
        Because I mostly dealt with text datasets, it was essential to understand how different countries and health systems adopt different policies. 
        I encrypted the patients’ personal information; used NLP to map the entries to standardized clinical terms such as SNOMED CT, ECDS, or ICD-10 codes; 
        and finally created a new database that consolidated datasets from 10 different countries and allowed Dr. Medlin to easily look up information by searching 
        on a patient’s unique ID. What I loved the most about this experience was coming to see the relationship between the medical field and information from a new perspective; 
        namely, I got a first-hand view into the role of information studies in enabling other fields to manage, use, and analyze data efficiently. 
        In particular, the medical field is characterized by large collections of data from past patients, including records from other countries, 
        that can be studied to enable better clinical practice. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to make my own contributions to this effort.
